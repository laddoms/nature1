This is the repo for all files for the website http://westernmassexplorenatureproject.com
Western Massachusetts Nature Exploration Project is a website that provides resources for local families wishing to explore nature in and around western Massachusetts
and the Berkshires. The website also provides information about Nature Deficit Disorder (NDD). 
This website served as my capstone project for my MS IT degree.

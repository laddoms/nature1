					<h3>About Nature Deficit Disorder</h3>
					<p>
						Richard Louv coined the term, Nature Deficit Disorder (NDD). Nature Deficit Disorder is a non medical condition that Mr. Louv suggests causes
						stress, anxiety, obesity, attention deficiencies, and lack of appreciation for nature in children. 
					</p>
					<p>
					   For decades families have been spending more and more time indoors and in urban areas away from nature. Advancing technology has 
					   increased this trend. Now more than ever families with children are spending more time in front of screens interacting with various
					   forms of technology instead of adventuring outdoors to play and explore nature in unstructured ways. 
					</p>
					<p>
					   Urban and suburban sprawl increases the effect of nature deficit disorder. Open green space is going away. Both parents and children 
					   are busier than ever and find less time to get away from the stress of cities and crowds and into calming natural environments. 
					</p>

					<h3>Our Mission</h3>
					<p>
					   The Western Massachusetts Children's Nature Exploration Project believes we can help combat NDD by providing resources, 
					   education, and encouragement for parents and children to begin exploring nature and events for families in our local area. 
					</p>
					<p>
					   We are fortunate to have an abundance of open space, mountains, fields, waterways, and lakes to explore and play in. Our state and 
					   local parks offer activities for families year round. There is wildlife to view around every corner. Peace, solitude, fun, adventure, and 
					   exploration await children and parents who venture outside, both within their city limits and in the surrounding country. 
					</p>
					<p>
					   The Western Massachusetts Children's Nature Exploration Project aims to be your one stop resource for local outdoor information, and 
                       interaction with other adventurists.
